## Quick Start

### Windows (Executable)

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/prof79/fansly-downloader-ng/releases/latest)
2. Extract and run `fansly_downloader_gui.exe`
3. Complete the setup wizard with your Fansly auth token
4. Add creators and start downloading

### Python (All Platforms)

**Requirements:** Python 3.11 or higher

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the GUI:
   ```bash
   python fansly_downloader_gui.py
   ```
   Or use the CLI:
   ```bash
   python fansly_downloader_ng.py
   ```

## GUI Features

- **Setup Wizard** - Automatic configuration on first run
- **Creator Management** - Visual list to add/remove creators
- **Real-time Progress** - See downloads in progress with file counts
- **Connection Testing** - Verify credentials before downloading
- **Log Access** - Press Ctrl+L to view diagnostic logs
- **Incremental Mode** - Toggle to download only new content

## CLI Usage

The command-line version supports all features with additional options for automation:

```bash
# Basic usage
python fansly_downloader_ng.py

# Non-interactive mode (no prompts)
python fansly_downloader_ng.py -ni

# Incremental mode (download only new content)
python fansly_downloader_ng.py -i

# Specify creators via command line
python fansly_downloader_ng.py -u creator1,creator2

# Silent mode for scripts/scheduled tasks
python fansly_downloader_ng.py -ni -npox
```

Run with `--help` to see all available options.

## Configuration

Settings are stored in `config.ini` which is created automatically on first run. You can edit this file to customize:

- Download directory
- Download modes (timeline, messages, collections)
- Rate limiting delays
- Duplicate handling
- Incremental mode settings
- Debug logging

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/prof79/fansly-downloader-ng/wiki) for detailed configuration options.

## Incremental Downloads

Incremental mode downloads only new content since your last run:

1. Enable in GUI Settings or use `-i` flag in CLI
2. First run downloads everything and saves position
3. Future runs download only new posts/messages
4. State tracked per creator in `download_history.json`

This saves bandwidth and time for regular downloads.

## Building from Source

### Create Windows Executable

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
python build_exe.py
```

The executable will be in `dist/fansly_downloader_gui.exe`

### Development

Install development dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

Linux users may need to install Tkinter separately:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

## Troubleshooting

**Empty fields after setup wizard:**
- Check `fansly_downloader.log` for errors (Ctrl+L in GUI)
- Ensure complete token and user agent are pasted
- Try running setup wizard again

**Downloads failing:**
- Verify auth token using "Test Connection"
- Check download path exists and has write permissions
- Review log file for specific errors
- Ensure active subscriptions to creators

**Application crashes:**
- Check `fansly_downloader.log` in application directory
- Try deleting `config.ini` and `gui_state.json` for fresh setup
- Ensure Python 3.11+ if running from source

## FAQ

**Q: Is this Windows-only?**
A: No. The executable is Windows-only, but the Python version works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

**Q: Will I get banned?**
A: Among 24,000+ users, there have been no reported bans. The tool respects rate limits and mimics normal browser behavior.

**Q: Does this bypass paywalls?**
A: No. You can only download content you have legitimate access to through your subscriptions.

**Q: Why do antivirus programs flag the executable?**
A: The executable is not digitally signed (certificates are expensive), causing false positives. You can build your own executable from the source code or run the Python version directly.

**Q: Can I use this on mobile?**
A: No, mobile devices are not currently supported.
