This is a rewrite/refactoring of [Avnsx](https://github.com/Avnsx)'s original [Fansly Downloader](https://github.com/Avnsx/fansly-downloader), expanded to support both Fansly and OnlyFans. **Fansly & OnlyFans Downloader NG** supports new features:

* Full command-line support for all options
* `config.ini` not required to start the program anymore - a `config.ini` with all program defaults will be generated automatically
* Support for minimal `config.ini` files - missing options will be added from program defaults automatically
* True multi-user support - put one or more creators as a list into `config.ini` (`username = creator1, creator2, creator3`) or supply via command-line
* Run it in non-interactive mode (`-ni`) without any user intervention - eg. when downloading while being away from the computer
* You may also run it in fully silent mode without the close prompt at the very end (`-ni -npox`) - eg. running **Fansly Downloader NG** from another script or from a scheduled task/cron job
* Logs all relevant messages (`Info`, `Warning`, `Error`, ...) of the last few sessions to `fansly_downloader_ng.log`. A history of 5 log files with a maximum size of 1 MiB will be preserved and can be deleted at your own discretion.
* Easier-to-extend, modern, modular and robust codebase
* It doesn't care about starring the repository

**Fansly & OnlyFans Downloader NG** is the go-to app for all your bulk media downloading needs. Download photos, videos, audio or any other media from Fansly and OnlyFans.

For detailed configuration settings, see the [Wiki](https://github.com/Frangus90/fansly-downloader-ng/wiki/Explanation-of-provided-programs-&-their-functionality#explanation-of-configini).

## Quick Start

### Fansly

#### Windows (Executable)

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/Frangus90/fansly-downloader-ng/releases/latest)
2. Extract and run `fansly_downloader_gui.exe`
3. Complete the setup wizard with your Fansly auth token
4. Add creators and start downloading

#### Python (All Platforms)

**Requirements:** Python 3.11 or higher

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the GUI:
   ```bash
   python fansly_downloader_gui.py
   ```
   Or use the CLI:
   ```bash
   python fansly_downloader_ng.py
   ```

**Note:** Using a [Python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) is recommended but out-of-scope of this guide.

On Linux, you may need to install Tkinter separately:
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

On Windows and macOS, the `Tkinter` module is typically included in the Python installer.

Raw Python code versions of **Fansly Downloader NG** do not receive automatic updates. If an update is available you will be notified but need to manually download and set-up the [current repository](https://github.com/Frangus90/fansly-downloader-ng/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) again.

### OnlyFans

OnlyFans is supported through both GUI and CLI:

#### GUI (Recommended)

1. Run `fansly_downloader_gui.exe` (Windows) or `python fansly_downloader_gui.py`
2. Switch to the **OnlyFans tab**
3. Enter your OnlyFans credentials (sess, auth_id, user_agent, x-bc)
4. Add creators and configure settings
5. Click "Start OF Download"

For help obtaining credentials, click the **"How to get credentials"** link in the OnlyFans tab.

#### CLI

```bash
# Run OnlyFans downloader
python onlyfans_downloader.py

# Non-interactive mode
python onlyfans_downloader.py -ni

# Incremental mode
python onlyfans_downloader.py -i
```

**Note:** OnlyFans uses a separate configuration file (`onlyfans_config.ini`) completely independent from Fansly settings.

- **SSIM Score** - Color-coded quality indicator (green = excellent, yellow = good, red = poor)
- **Smart Format Detection** - Warns when PNG is selected (lossless, no quality difference to compare)

**Advanced Compression Options:**
- **Target File Size** - Compress images to a specific file size (e.g., 5 MB) while maximizing quality
- **MozJPEG Optimization** - 10-15% smaller files at the same visual quality
- **SSIM Quality Validation** - Warns when compression reduces perceptual quality below your threshold
- **Chroma Subsampling** - Choose between best quality (4:4:4), balanced (4:2:2), or smallest size (4:2:0)
- **Minimum Quality Floor** - Prevent over-compression by setting a quality floor (60-90)
- **Progressive JPEG** - Better loading experience for web use

**Usage:**
1. Open Tools → Image Crop Tool from the main menu
2. Upload images or drag-and-drop them onto the window
3. Use the **Crop Preview** tab to adjust crop box on each image
4. Switch to **Compress Preview** tab to compare original vs compressed quality
5. Choose output format and quality settings
6. Expand "Advanced Options" for compression fine-tuning
7. Process batch to export all cropped images

**File Handling:**
- Automatically detects existing files and offers overwrite/skip options
- Preserves original filenames by default
- Supports all common image formats (.jpg, .png, .webp, .gif, .bmp)

## CLI Usage

The command-line version supports all features with additional options for automation.

### Fansly CLI

```bash
# Basic usage
python fansly_downloader_ng.py

# Non-interactive mode (no prompts)
python fansly_downloader_ng.py -ni

# Incremental mode (download only new content)
python fansly_downloader_ng.py -i

# Specify creators via command line
python fansly_downloader_ng.py -u creator1,creator2

# Silent mode for scripts/scheduled tasks
python fansly_downloader_ng.py -ni -npox
```

Run with `--help` to see all available options.

### OnlyFans CLI

```bash
# Basic usage
python onlyfans_downloader.py

# Non-interactive mode (no prompts)
python onlyfans_downloader.py -ni

# Incremental mode (download only new content)
python onlyfans_downloader.py -i

# Specify creators via command line
python onlyfans_downloader.py -u creator1,creator2

# Silent mode for scripts/scheduled tasks
python onlyfans_downloader.py -ni -npox
```

Run with `--help` to see all available options. OnlyFans uses `onlyfans_config.ini` for configuration.

## Configuration

The application uses separate configuration files for each platform:

### Fansly Configuration (`config.ini`)

Created automatically on first run for Fansly. Customize:

- Download directory
- Download modes (timeline, messages, collections)
- Rate limiting delays
- Duplicate handling
- Incremental mode settings
- Debug logging

### OnlyFans Configuration (`onlyfans_config.ini`)

Created automatically when using OnlyFans features. Completely independent from Fansly settings:

- Download directory
- OnlyFans credentials (sess, auth_id, user_agent, x-bc)
- Creator list
- Rate limiting and retry settings
- Incremental mode settings
- Post limit for new creators

**Note:** Both platforms maintain separate download histories and states, allowing you to use both simultaneously without conflicts.

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/Frangus90/fansly-downloader-ng/wiki) for detailed configuration options.

## Incremental Downloads

Incremental mode downloads only new content since your last run:

1. Enable in GUI Settings or use `-i` flag in CLI
2. First run downloads everything and saves position
3. Future runs download only new posts/messages
4. State tracked per creator in `download_history.json`

This saves bandwidth and time for regular downloads.

## Building from Source

### Create Windows Executable

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
python build_exe.py
```

The executable will be in `dist/fansly_downloader_gui.exe`

The build script automatically includes all required assets, icons, and dependencies.

### Development

Install development dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

## Troubleshooting

**Empty fields after setup wizard:**
- Check `fansly_downloader.log` for errors (Ctrl+L in GUI)
- Ensure complete token and user agent are pasted
- Try running setup wizard again

**Downloads failing:**
- Verify auth token using "Test Connection"
- Check download path exists and has write permissions
- Review log file for specific errors
- Ensure active subscriptions to creators

**Application crashes:**
- Check `fansly_downloader.log` in application directory
- Try deleting `config.ini` and `gui_state.json` for fresh setup
- Ensure Python 3.11+ if running from source

**Where is the log file?**
- Same directory as the application executable or Python script
- Named `fansly_downloader.log` (or `fansly_downloader_ng.log` for CLI)
- Contains all diagnostic output including errors and progress

## FAQ

**Q: Does this support OnlyFans?**
A: Yes! Full OnlyFans support with both GUI (dedicated tab) and CLI (`onlyfans_downloader.py`). OnlyFans uses a completely separate configuration system from Fansly, so you can use both platforms simultaneously.

**Q: Is this Windows-only?**
A: No. The executable is Windows-only, but the Python version works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

**Q: Will I get banned?**
A: While there are no guarantees, it's worth noting that among the 24,000+ previous users, there have been no reported incidents. The tool respects rate limits and mimics normal browser behavior for both platforms.

**Q: Does this bypass paywalls?**
A: No. You can only download content you have legitimate access to through your subscriptions. No paywall bypassing features will be added.

**Q: Why do antivirus programs flag the executable?**
A: The executable is not digitally signed (certificates are expensive), causing false positives. You can build your own executable from the source code or run the Python version directly. If you're knowledgeable with Python, you can decompile a PyInstaller executable using tools like [uncompyle6](https://github.com/rocky/python-uncompyle6/) to verify no harmful code is included.

**Q: Can I use this on mobile?**
A: No, mobile devices are not currently supported.

**Q: Could you add X feature or do X change?**
A: I'm regrettably very limited on time and thus primarily do stuff I find useful myself. You can contribute code by [opening a pull request](https://github.com/Frangus90/fansly-downloader-ng/pulls).

Please note that "Issue" tickets are reserved for reporting genuine or suspected bugs in the codebase of the downloader which require attention from the developer. They are not for general computer user problems.

## What's New

For the latest release notes and version history, see [ReleaseNotes.md](ReleaseNotes.md).

⚠️ Due to a [hashing bug](../../issues/13) duplicate videos might be downloaded if a creator re-posts a lot. Downloaded videos will have to be renamed in a future version when video hashing is perfected.
